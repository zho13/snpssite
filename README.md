# snpssite

a couple notes to get started:
- first, delete the current top_SNPs.txt file. the first time you upload a file, a new one should be created--it'll take a while, but only needs to run once
- add the new .sql file to the tmp folder and in database.py, change the filename in create_engine to the new .sql file

commands:

source sqlalchemy-workspace/bin/activate
python snps/SNP-site.py
